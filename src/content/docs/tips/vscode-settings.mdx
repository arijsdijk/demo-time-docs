In addition to the [Demo Time VS Code settings](/references/settings/) there are a number of settings that you may find useful to set in your [VS Code settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_workspace-settings).

## Terminal Placement
By default VS Code places any new terminal windows at the bottom of the screen. 

When presenting it can be useful to set the default location of new terminal windows to `editor` rather than `view`. This will then create new terminals in an editor tab providing more space.

```
{
    "terminal.integrated.defaultLocation": "editor"
}
```

## Font Sizes
Demo Time allows you to set the zoom level when highlighting text however it can be useful to set a default font size.

This can be done for both the editor and the terminal independently.

```
{
    "editor.fontSize": 20,
    "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 25
}
