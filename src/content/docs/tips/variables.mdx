You can define variables in a `variables.json` file in the `.demo` folder. Once you created the `variables.json` file and added variables/constants to it, you can use these variables in your demo steps by using curly braces `{variable_name}`.

## Example variables file

```json
{
  "SLIDES_URL": "http://localhost:3030"
}
```

## Example usage in demo steps

```json
{
  "action": "executeVSCodeCommand",
  "command": "simpleBrowser.show",
  "args": "{SLIDES_URL}"
}
```
