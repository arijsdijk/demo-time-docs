When you want to insert content to a file, you can use the `content` or `contentPath` properties in the demo step.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `content` | This property allows you to add the content directly in the JSON file, but this can make your JSON file quite big and it can be hard to read. |
| `contentPath` | This property allows you to reference a file in the `.demo` folder. This way you can keep your JSON file clean and add the content in separate files. **Important**: the path is relative to the `.demo` folder. |

## Using the `contentPath` property

When you use the `contentPath` property, you can reference a file in the `.demo` folder. This way you can keep your JSON file clean and add the content in separate files.

<Aside type="caution">
The indentation of the file will be preserved when you insert the content. This means that you have to be careful with the indentation of the content you add.

You can add an `executeVSCodeCommand` action with the `editor.action.reindentlines` command to reindent the content.
