Once you have created your demos, you can manually trigger the steps from the Demo Time panel view, trigger them from the command palette with the `Demo Time: Start` command, or enter presentation mode to use a presenter/clicker to navigate through your demos.

## Toggle Presentation Mode

To enter presentation mode, you can click on the "projector" icon in the Demo Time panel view or use the `Demo Time: Start Presentation Mode` command from the command palette.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={presentationModeImage} alt="Enter presentation mode" width="400" />

When you enter presentation mode, if you have multiple demo sections, you can select the one you would like to start with.

Once you are in presentation mode, you can use your right arrow key or right presenter/clicker button to navigate through the steps of your demos.

<Aside type="tip">
If you want, you can override the default keybindings for the presenter/clicker buttons by updating the `demoTime.start` and `demo-time.previous` commands in the keybindings settings (use the `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts` command).
</Aside>

## Enable to go back action

If you would like to enable the ability to go back to the previous step, you can enable this by updating the `demoTime.previousEnabled` setting to `true`.

<Code code={`{
    "demoTime.previousEnabled": true
}`} 
  lang="json" 
  title={`.vscode/settings.json`} />

When you enabled this setting, you can use your left arrow key or left presenter/clicker button to navigate back to the previous step.

<Aside type="caution">
The ability to go back is disabled by default because some demos may involve changes to content in previous steps. Re-running these steps could cause conflicts or errors.
