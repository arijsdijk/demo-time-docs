## Think like a presenter, not just a developer

Demo Time works best when you think of your presentation as a **journey**:

- What do you want the audience to feel or understand?
- Where should you pause, explain, highlight, or run code?
- What steps are *essential* vs *supporting*?

## Typical flow of a Demo Time session

1. Script your demo steps
2. Test out the flow (optional but recommended)
2. Use `presentation mode` to automatically advance (vs clicking manually) with the keyboard shortcuts (`→`) or right arrow on your clicker
3. Mix code walkthroughs with slides — all in VS Code
4. Stay focused while Demo Time handles the flow

## How to start presenting

Once you have created your demos, you can manually trigger the steps from the Demo Time panel view, trigger them from the command palette with the `Demo Time: Start` command, or enter presentation mode to use a presenter/clicker to navigate through your demos.

To enter presentation mode, click the "projector" icon in the Demo Time panel view or use the `Demo Time: Start Presentation Mode` command from the command palette.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={presentationModeImage} alt="Enter presentation mode" width="400" />

When you enter presentation mode, if you have multiple demo sections, you can select the one you would like to start with.

Once you are in presentation mode, you can use your right arrow key or right presenter/clicker button to navigate through the steps of your demos.

If you want, you can override the default keybindings for the presenter/clicker buttons by updating the `demoTime.start` and `demo-time.previous` commands in the keybindings settings (use the `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts` command).

## Tips for presenting

- **Test with timing**: Practice your script while talking through each step
- **Use `presentation mode`**: Avoid clicking through steps mid-talk
- **Keep the demo focused**: Add extra info in comments, not in live code
- **Backup plan**: Keep your demos self-contained so you can restart easily for when you would add manual changes

## Enable to go back action

If you would like to enable the ability to go back to the previous step, you can enable this by updating the `demoTime.previousEnabled` setting to `true`.

<Code code={`{
    "demoTime.previousEnabled": true
}`} 
  lang="json" 
  title={`.vscode/settings.json`} />

When you enabled this setting, you can use your left arrow key or left presenter/clicker button to navigate back to the previous step.

<Aside type="caution">
The ability to go back is disabled by default because some demos may involve changes to content in previous steps. Re-running these steps could cause conflicts or errors.
