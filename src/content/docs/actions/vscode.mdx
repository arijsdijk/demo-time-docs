Visual Studio Code actions are used to perform actions related to Visual Studio Code in the editor. You can use these actions to execute commands, show information messages, and more.

<Aside type="note" title='Samples'>
  You can find VSCode actions samples on GitHub:

## Execute a Visual Studio Code command

Execute a Visual Studio Code command using the `executeVSCodeCommand` action.

```json
{
  "action": "executeVSCodeCommand",
  "command": "<command to execute>",
  "args": "<arguments to pass to the command (optional)>",
  "path": "<relative path to the file (optional, when defined, the args property is ignored.)>"
}
```

### How to find the command to execute

You can find the command to execute by opening the command palette in Visual Studio Code (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and typing the command you want to execute. The command palette will show you the available commands that match your search query.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={gearImage} alt="Gear icon on the command in the command palette" />

Next to the command, you can see the "gear" icon. When you click on this icon, you get redirected to the keyboard shortcuts page where you can right-click on the command and select "Copy Command ID" to copy the command ID.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={copyImage} alt="Copy the command ID" />

## Show an information message

Show an information message in Visual Studio Code using the `showInfoMessage` action.

```json
{
  "action": "showInfoMessage",
  "message": "<message>"
}
```

## Set state

The `setState` action allows you to set a key/value pair in the extension state which can be accessed by other actions. You can use the state value in your demo steps by using the following `{STATE_<key>}` syntax.

```json
{
  "action": "setState",
  "state": {
    "key": "<key>",
    "value": "<value>"
  }
}
```

### Store the clipboard content in the extension state

For example, you could use this action in combination with the `{DT_CLIPBOARD}` variable to store the clipboard content in the extension state and then use it in another action.

<Aside type="danger" title="Important">
The variables extension state gets reset when the extension starts up, or when you reset all the demos.
</Aside>

```json
{
  "action": "setState",
  "state": {
    "key": "resourceID",
    "value": "{DT_CLIPBOARD}"
  }
}
```

To use the stored value in another action, you can reference it using the `{STATE_<key>}` syntax.

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "path": "sample.json",
  "content": "{\n  \"firstName\": \"{STATE_resourceID}\"\n}"
}
```

## Open a website

Open a website in your browser or in the editor using the `openWebsite` action.

```json
{
  "action": "openWebsite",
  "url": "<URL>",
  "openInVSCode": "<true/false>"
}
```

## Copy content to clipboard

Copy text or file content to your clipboard using the `copyToClipboard` action.

### Copy a string to the clipboard

Use the `content` property to copy a specific string:

```json
{
  "action": "copyToClipboard",
  "content": "Hello from Demo Time!"
}
```

### Copy file content to the clipboard

Use the `contentPath` property to copy the contents of a file:

```json
{
  "action": "copyToClipboard",
  "contentPath": ".demo/vscode/copy-test.txt"
}
```

### Copy content with variables

You can use state variables in the clipboard content. First, set a state value, then reference it in the `content` property:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "setState",
    "state": {
      "key": "TEST_STATE",
      "value": "DEMO TIME"
    }
  },
  {
    "action": "copyToClipboard",
    "content": "Clipboard with state value: {STATE_TEST_STATE}"
  }
]
```

The `{STATE_TEST_STATE}` variable will be replaced with the value you set in the state.

<Aside type="tip">
  You can use both <code>content</code> and <code>contentPath</code> to control what gets copied to the clipboard, and combine with state for dynamic content.
