Terminal actions are used to perform actions related to the terminal in the editor. You can use these actions to run commands, clear the terminal, and more.

## Execute a terminal command

Execute a terminal command in the terminal.

```json
{
  "action": "executeTerminalCommand",
  "command": "<command to execute>",
  "terminalId": "<terminal id (optional)>"
}
```

## Execute a script in the background

Execute a script in the background of which you can use the output in the next steps.

```json
{
  "action": "executeScript",
  "id": "<script id>",
  "path": "<script to execute>",
  "command": "node" // Can be powershell, bash, shell, python, etc.
}
```

<Aside>
If you want, you can use the output of the script in the next steps with `STATE_<script id>` syntax.

Make sure you defined the `id` property and that your script only writes a single line of output.

### Example of using the output of a script

<Code code={`{
    "title": "Script example",
    "description": "",
    "steps": [
        {
            "action": "executeScript",
            "id": "firstName",
            "path": "writeFirstName.mjs",
            "command": "node"
        },
        {
            "action": "create",
            "path": "sample.json",
            "content": "{\\n  \\"firstName\\": \\"{SCRIPT_firstName}\\"\\n}"
        },
        {
            "action": "open",
            "path": "sample.json"
        }
    ]
