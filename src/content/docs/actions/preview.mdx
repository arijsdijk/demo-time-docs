Preview actions are used to preview files like Markdown and images in the editor.

## Show slides

To show slides with Demo Time, you can make use of the `openSlide` action.

```json
{
  "action": "openSlide",
  "path": "<relative path to the file>"
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
  You can use a custom theme for your slides by providing a relative path or URL to a CSS file to the `customTheme` property in the frontmatter section of your Markdown file.
</Aside>

Read more about it in the [slides](/slides/) section of the documentation.

## Preview Markdown file

To preview a markdown file in the editor, use the `markdownPreview` action. The `markdownPreview` action takes a file `path` as an argument.

```json
{
  "action": "markdownPreview",
  "path": "<relative path to the file>"
}
```

## Preview image

To preview an image in the editor, use the `imagePreview` action. The `imagePreview` action takes a file `path` as an argument.

```json
{
  "action": "imagePreview",
  "path": "<relative path to the file>",
  "theme": "<relative path to CSS file>"
}
```

### Custom theming

Create a CSS file, and adapt the styling with the `.preview_view` class.

<Code code={`.preview_view {
     background-color: #000;
}`} 
  lang="css" 
  title={`.demo/themes/image.css`} />
