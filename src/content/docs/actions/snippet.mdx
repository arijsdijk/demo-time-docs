Snippets can be used when you have steps that you want to reuse in multiple demos. You can define a snippet in the `.demo` folder and reference it in your demo files.

## Using a snippet

Use the `snippet` action to reference a snippet in your demo.

```jsonc
{
  "action": "snippet",
  "contentPath": "<relative path to the file in the .demo folder>",
  "args": {
    // Define the argument name in the snippet file with curly braces {argument name}
    "<argument name>": "<argument value>"
  }
}
```

Start by creating a snippet folder/file in the `.demo` folder. For example, you can create a `snippets` folder and a `insert_and_highlight.json` file.

The contents of this file could look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "unselect",
    "path": "{MAIN_FILE}"
  },
  {
    "action": "insert",
    "path": "{MAIN_FILE}",
    "contentPath": "{CONTENT_PATH}",
    "position": "{CONTENT_POSITION}"
  },
  {
    "action": "highlight",
    "path": "{MAIN_FILE}",
    "position": "{HIGHLIGHT_POSITION}"
  }
]
```

<Aside type="tip">
You can make use of variables/placeholders in the snippet file by using curly braces `{argument name}`. These variables are defined in the `args` property of the snippet action.

In your demo file, you can reference the snippet like this:

```json
{
  "action": "snippet",
  "contentPath": "./snippets/insert_and_highlight.json",
  "args": {
    "MAIN_FILE": "sample.json",
    "CONTENT_PATH": "content.txt",
    "CONTENT_POSITION": "3",
    "HIGHLIGHT_POSITION": "4"
  }
}
```
