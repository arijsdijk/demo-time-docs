External application actions allow you to open or interact with applications outside of your editor as part of your demo flow.

## Open PowerPoint

Open Microsoft PowerPoint directly from your demo using the `openPowerPoint` action. This is useful when you want to demonstrate or reference a PowerPoint presentation as part of your workflow.

```json
{
  "action": "openPowerPoint"
}
```

<Aside type="note" title="PowerPoint must be installed">
  This action requires Microsoft PowerPoint to be installed on your system. The action attempts to open the running PowerPoint instance.
