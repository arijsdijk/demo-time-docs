Setting actions are used to perform actions related to settings in the editor. You can use these actions to update settings, change themes, and more.

## Update a setting

Update a setting in Visual Studio Code using the `setSetting` action.

```json
{
  "action": "setSetting",
  "setting": {
    "key": "<setting key>",
    "value": "<value>"
  }
}
```

### Example of updating a setting

Here is an example of how you can hide the activity and status bar in Visual Studio Code.

```json
{
  "action": "setSetting",
  "args": {
    "setting": "workbench.statusBar.visible",
    "value": false
  }
}, 
{
  "action": "setSetting",
  "args": {
    "setting": "workbench.activityBar.location",
    "value": "hidden"
  }
}
```

To reset the settings, you can use the following steps:

```json
{
  "action": "setSetting",
  "setting": {
    "key": "workbench.statusBar.visible",
    "value": null
  }
}, 
{
  "action": "setSetting",
  "setting": {
    "key": "workbench.activityBar.location",
    "value": null
  }
}
```

## Set a themes

Set a theme in Visual Studio Code using the `setTheme` action.

```json
{
  "action": "setTheme",
  "theme": "<theme name>"
}
```

## Unset a theme

Unset a theme in Visual Studio Code using the `unsetTheme` action.

```json
{
  "action": "unsetTheme"
}
```

## Set the presentation mode

Set the presentation mode in Visual Studio Code using the `setPresentationMode` action. This action turns on settings to hide the status bar, tabs, and activity bar.

```json
{
  "action": "setPresentationMode"
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
  You can use the `setPresentationMode` action when you are starting a presentation to hide the UI elements. You can also trigger this from the slide controls.
</Aside>

## Unset the presentation mode

Unset the presentation mode in Visual Studio Code using the `unsetPresentationMode` action. This action turns off settings to show the status bar, tabs, and activity bar.

```json
{
  "action": "unsetPresentationMode"
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
  You can use the `unsetPresentationMode` action in the demo right after a slide to make sure all UI elements are visible again. You can also trigger this from the slide controls.
