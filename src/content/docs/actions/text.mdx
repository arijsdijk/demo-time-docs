Text actions are used to insert, replace, highlight, delete or unselect text in the editor.

Most of these actions make use of the `path` property to specify the location of the file, and the `position` property to specify the location where the action should be performed.

For the `position` property, you can use the following values:

- `number`: The line number
- `number:number`: The start and end line number
- `number,number`: The start line and character
- `number,number:number,number`: The start line and character and the end line and character
- The `start` and `end` keywords can also be used instead of the line numbers
  - `start` will be replaced by the first line number
  - `end` will be replaced by the last line number

Examples:

```jsonc
"position": "10" // Line 10
"position": "10:20" // Lines 10 to 20
"position": "10,5" // Start line 10, character 5
"position": "10,5:20,10" // Start line 10, character 5 to end line 20, character 10
```

## Highlight text

Highlight text in the editor at a specific location.

```json
{
  "action": "highlight",
  "path": "<relative path to the file>",
  "position": "<position>",
  "zoom": "<zoom level> (optional)"
}
```
