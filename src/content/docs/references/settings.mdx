| `demoTime.showClock` | Show a clock in the status bar. | `true` |
| `demoTime.timer` | Count down timer for how long the session should last. If not set, it will not count down. The value is the number of minutes. | `null` |

<Aside>
The `demoTime.previousEnabled` is by default disabled to avoid conflicts when the previous action inserted content into a file.

When you enable this setting, you can use the `Demo Time: Previous` command to go back to the previous step or use the left clicker button.
