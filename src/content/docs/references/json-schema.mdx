The JSON schema for the Demo Time configuration is used to validate the configuration file. This schema is used to ensure that the configuration file is correctly formatted and that all the required properties are present.

Make sure to include the following JSON schema URL in your demo file: 

`https://demotime.elio.dev/demo-time.schema.json`

## Example

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://demotime.elio.dev/demo-time.schema.json",
  "title": "Demo",
  "description": "Demo description",
  "demos": []
}
```
