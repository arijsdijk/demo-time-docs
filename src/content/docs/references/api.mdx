The extension provides an API which you can use to control the extension. 

You can enable the API by setting the `demoTime.api.enabled` setting to `true`. 

Once the API is enabled, it will run on the port defined in the `demoTime.api.port` setting.

API URL: `http://localhost:3710/api/next`

Once enabled, it shows the API and its port number in the status bar of Visual Studio Code.

## API endpoints

### `/api/next`

This endpoint will execute the next step in the demo.

- Method: `GET`
- Query parameters:
  - `bringToFront`: Bring the Visual Studio Code window to the front. Default is `false`.

<Aside type="caution">
  To make use of the `bringToFront` parameter, you need to make sure the `code` command is available in your system's PATH. If you have not yet installed the `code` command, you can do so by executing the `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` command from the command palette in Visual Studio Code.
