Timing is everything. To keep an eye on the time, you can use the clock and timer functions from Demo Time.

## Clock

The clock is visible in the Presenter View and the status bar from Visual Studio Code which is located at the bottom of the editor.

By default, the clock is enabled. If you want to disable it, you can set the `demoTime.showClock` setting to `false`.

<Code code={`{
    "demoTime.showClock": true
}`} 
  lang="json" 
  title={`.vscode/settings.json`} />

## Timer

When the clock is enabled, you can also make use of the timer. The timer is a countdown that you can start by clicking on the clock in the status bar.

The timer will start at the time you clicked on the clock and will count down to zero. When the timer reaches zero, it will turn red and keeps counting up to indicate the time that has passed since the timer reached zero.

You can define the duration of the timer by setting the `demoTime.timer` setting to the desired duration in minutes.

<Code code={`{
    "demoTime.timer": 45
}`} 
  lang="json" 
  title={`.vscode/settings.json`} />

You can also pause and resume the timer as needed. To pause the timer, simply click on it in the status bar. Clicking it again will resume the timer from where it left off. This allows for flexibility during your presentation, for instance, when you need to address questions or engage in discussions.
