## Timer

When the clock is enabled, you can also make use of the timer. The timer is a countdown that you can start by clicking on the clock in the status bar.

The timer will start at the time you clicked on the clock and will count down to zero. When the timer reaches zero, it will turn red and keeps counting up to indicate the time that has passed since the timer reached zero.

You can define the duration of the timer in two ways:

- **Globally:** Set the `demotime.timer` setting in your `.vscode/settings.json` file to specify the default timer duration (in minutes) for all demos.

  <Code code={`{
    "demotime.timer": 45
  }`} 
    lang="json" 
    title={`.vscode/settings.json`} />

- **Per demo file:** Override the timer duration for a specific demo by adding a `timer` property to the demo file's frontmatter.

  ```json title="demo.json"
  {
    "$schema": "https://demotime.show/demo-time.schema.json",
    "title": "Demo",
    "description": "Demo description",
    "version": 2,
    "timer": 45, // Set the timer to 45 minutes
    "demos": []
  }
    ```

You can also pause and resume the timer as needed. To pause the timer, simply click on it in the status bar. Clicking it again will resume the timer from where it left off. This allows for flexibility during your presentation, for instance, when you need to address questions or engage in discussions.
