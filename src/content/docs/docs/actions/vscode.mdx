Visual Studio Code actions are used to perform actions related to Visual Studio Code in the editor. You can use these actions to execute commands, show information messages, and more.

## Execute a Visual Studio Code command

Execute a Visual Studio Code command using the `executeVSCodeCommand` action.

```json
{
  "action": "executeVSCodeCommand",
  "command": "<command to execute>",
  "args": "<arguments to pass to the command (optional)>",
  "path": "<relative path to the file (optional, when defined, the args property is ignored.)>"
}
```

### How to find the command to execute

You can find the command to execute by opening the command palette in Visual Studio Code (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and typing the command you want to execute. The command palette will show you the available commands that match your search query.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={gearImage} alt="Gear icon on the command in the command palette" />

Next to the command, you can see the "gear" icon. When you click on this icon, you get redirected to the keyboard shortcuts page where you can right-click on the command and select "Copy Command ID" to copy the command ID.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={copyImage} alt="Copy the command ID" />

## Show an information message

Show an information message in Visual Studio Code using the `showInfoMessage` action.

```json
{
  "action": "showInfoMessage",
  "message": "<message>"
}
```
