Text actions are used to insert, replace, highlight, delete or unselect text in the editor.

Most of these actions make use of the `path` property to specify the location of the file, and the `position` property to specify the location where the action should be performed.

For the `position` property, you can use the following values:

- `number`: The line number where the action should be performed.
- `number:number`: The start and end line numbers where the action should be performed.
- The `start` and `end` keywords can also be used instead of the line numbers
  - `start` will be replaced by the first line number
  - `end` will be replaced by the last line number

## Insert text

  "position": "<line number> or <start line number>:<end line number>",
  "content": "<content of the file> (optional)",
  "contentPath": "<relative path to the file in the .demo folder> (optional)",
  "lineInsertionDelay": "<delay in milliseconds to insert each line> (optional)"
}
```

## Replace text
