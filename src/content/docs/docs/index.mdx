To get started with Demo Time, you need to install the extension in Visual Studio Code. You can find the extension in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-demo-time).

You can install the extension via the following link: [install the extension](vscode:extension/eliostruyf.vscode-front-matter).

## Initialize the extension

Once you have installed the extension, it is time to initialize it in your project where you want to use it. You can do this by opening the explorer panel in Visual Studio Code. There should be a **Demo Time** view available in which you find the **Initialize** button.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={initializeImage} alt="Initialize Demo Time" width="400" />

Once you clicked on the **Initialize** button, the extension will create a `.demo` folder in your workspace with a `demo.json` file.

<Aside type="tip">
You can change the `demo.json` filename to any other name you prefer. The extension will still recognize it. You can also create multiple files if you want to split your demos.
</Aside>

## Adding your first demo

Now that you have initialized the extension, you can start adding your first demo steps.

You can open the newly created `demo.json` file in the `.demo` folder manually, or you can click on the "eye" icon in the **Demo Time** view to open the demo steps editor.

<Image class="mx-auto" src={openImage} alt="Open the first demo file" width="400" />

The default content of the `demo.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://elio.dev/demo-time.schema.json",
  "title": "Demo",
  "description": "Demo description",
  "demos": []
}
```

You can start adding your demos in the `demos` array. Each demo should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "steps": []
}
```

You can also add icons to the demo to make them more recognizable.

```json
{
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "icons": {
    "start": "<name of the icon (optional)>",
    "end": "<name of the icon (optional)>"
  },
  "steps": []
}
```

<Aside type="note">
Use the icon names you can find in the [icon listing](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels#icon-listing) from the Visual Studio Code documentation.
</Aside>

Here is an example of a demo where you create a file and open it:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://elio.dev/demo-time.schema.json",
  "title": "Demo",
  "description": "Demo description",
  "demos": [
    {
      "title": "Create and open sample.json",
      "description": "Create a sample.json file with some content.",
      "icons": {
        "start": "file-code",
        "end": "pass-filled"
      },
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "create",
          "path": "sample.json",
          "content": "{\n  \"firstName\": \"Elio\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Struyf\"\n}"
        },
        {
          "action": "open",
          "path": "sample.json"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementing other demos and steps

You can add more demos and steps to the `demos` array. In the [actions section](docs/actions) of the documenation, you can find all the available actions you can use to create your demos.
