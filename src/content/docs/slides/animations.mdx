Demo Time provides you a couple of animation components to show or hide content during your presentations. On this page, you will learn how to use them.

## Show Content

The `dt-show` component allows you to reveal content after a specific number of clicks:

```markdown title="Click twice to show content"
<dt-show clicks="2">
  This content appears after 2 clicks
</dt-show>
```

If no clicks attribute is specified, the content will show after 1 click:

```markdown title="Click to show content"
<dt-show>
  This content appears after 1 click
</dt-show>
```

## Hide Content

The `dt-hide` component allows you to hide content after a specific number of clicks:

```markdown title="Click twice to hide content"
<dt-hide clicks="2">
  This content disappears after 2 clicks
</dt-hide>
```
