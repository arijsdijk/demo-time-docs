On this page you can find the list of built-in slide layouts available in Demo Time. These layouts can be used to structure your slides effectively.

By default, the slide uses the `default` layout, but you can change it per slide by providing the layout name in the front matter section of the slide:

```md
---
layout: intro
---

# Welcome to Demo Time!
```

## Default

The `default` layout is a standard slide layout that can be used for most slides.

```md
---
layout: default
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={defaultImg} alt="Default" />

## Intro

The `intro` layout is ideal for opening slides. It provides a large title area and a smaller content area.

```md
---
layout: intro
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={introImg} alt="Intro" />

## Section

The `section` layout is used to separate slides into sections. It provides a large title area and a smaller content area.

```md
---
layout: section
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={sectionImg} alt="Section" />

## Quote

The `quote` layout is perfect for displaying key takeaways or citations. It provides a large quote area and a smaller content area.


```md
---
layout: quote
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={quoteImg} alt="Quote" />

## Image

The `image` layout is used to display an image on the slide. It provides a large image area and a smaller content area.

```md
---
layout: image
image: "<url to the image>"
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={imageImg} alt="Image" />

## Image left

The `image-left` layout is similar to the `image` layout but with the image on the left side, and the content on the right side.

```md
---
layout: image-left
image: "<url to the image>"
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={imageLeftImg} alt="Image left" />

## Image right

The `image-right` layout is similar to the `image` layout but with the image on the right side, and the content on the left side.

```md
---
layout: image-right
image: "<url to the image>"
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={imageRightImg} alt="Image right" />

## Two columns

The `two-columns` layout is used to display content in two columns. It provides two equal-sized content areas. Use the `::right::` separator to split the content into two columns.

```md
---
layout: two-columns
---

<!-- Content on the left -->

::right::

<!-- Content on the right -->
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={twoColumnsImg} alt="Two columns" />

## Custom layout

You can also create your own custom layout by creating an HTML template that uses Handlebars as the templating engine. Define the relative path to the template in the `customLayout` property in the front matter section of the slide.

All slide properties will be passed to the template, and you can use them in your custom layout by using the following syntax:

```html
{{metadata.<property>}}
```

For the slide content, you can use the `{{{content}}}` property to render the content of the slide.

### Custom layout example

```html title="custom-layout.html"
<div>
  {{#if metadata.title}}<h1>{{metadata.title}}</h1>{{/if}}
  <div class="content">
    {{{content}}}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Using a custom layout

To use a custom layout, you can specify the path to the layout file in the front matter section of the slide:

```md title="slide-with-custom-layout.md"
---
customLayout: "custom-layout.html"
title: My custom layout
---

# This is my custom layout
```

### Outcome of the custom layout

```html
<div>
  <h1>My custom layout</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h1>This is my custom layout</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```
