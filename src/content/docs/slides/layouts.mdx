On this page you can find the list of built-in slide layouts available in Demo Time. These layouts can be used to structure your slides effectively.

By default, the slide uses the `default` layout, but you can change it per slide by providing the layout name in the front matter section of the slide:

```md
---
layout: intro
---

# Welcome to Demo Time!
```

## Default

The `default` layout is a standard slide layout that can be used for most slides.

```md
---
layout: default
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={defaultImg} alt="Default" />

## Intro

The `intro` layout is ideal for opening slides. It provides a large title area and a smaller content area.

```md
---
layout: intro
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={introImg} alt="Intro" />

## Section

The `section` layout is used to separate slides into sections. It provides a large title area and a smaller content area.

```md
---
layout: section
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={sectionImg} alt="Section" />

## Quote

The `quote` layout is perfect for displaying key takeaways or citations. It provides a large quote area and a smaller content area.


```md
---
layout: quote
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={quoteImg} alt="Quote" />

## Image

The `image` layout is used to display an image on the slide. It provides a large image area and a smaller content area.

```md
---
layout: image
image: "<url to the image>"
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={imageImg} alt="Image" />

## Image left

The `image-left` layout is similar to the `image` layout but with the image on the left side, and the content on the right side.

```md
---
layout: image-left
image: "<url to the image>"
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={imageLeftImg} alt="Image left" />

## Image right

The `image-right` layout is similar to the `image` layout but with the image on the right side, and the content on the left side.

```md
---
layout: image-right
image: "<url to the image>"
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={imageRightImg} alt="Image right" />

## Two columns

The `two-columns` layout is used to display content in two columns. It provides two equal-sized content areas. Use the `::right::` separator to split the content into two columns.

```md
---
layout: two-columns
---

<!-- Content on the left -->

::right::

<!-- Content on the right -->
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={twoColumnsImg} alt="Two columns" />
