import { Aside, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import imageLeftImg from "../../../../assets/docs/slide-layouts/image-left.webp";


The `image-left` layout is similar to the `image` layout but with the image on the left side, and the content on the right side.

```md
---
layout: image-left
image: "<url to the image>"
---
```

<Image class="mx-auto" src={imageLeftImg} alt="Image left" />
