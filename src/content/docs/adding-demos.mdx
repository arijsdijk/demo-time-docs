In the [getting started](/getting-started/) guide, you learned how to initialize the extension with a sample demo. In this guide, you will learn how to add your demos to the demo time configuration.

## Adding your first demo

Now that you have initialized the extension, you can start adding your first demo steps.

You can open the newly created `demo.json` file in the `.demo` folder manually, or you can click on the "eye" icon in the **Demo Time** view to open the demo steps editor.

<Aside type="tip">
It is a good practice to split your demos into multiple files. This way, you can keep your demos organized and easier to maintain.
</Aside>

The default content of the `demo.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://demotime.show/demo-time.schema.json",
  "title": "Demo",
  "description": "Demo description",
  "version": 2,
  "timer": 5, // Optional timer in minutes. You can also set it on global level with the `demoTime.timer` setting.
  "demos": []
}
```

You can start adding your demos in the `demos` array. Each demo should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "steps": []
}
```

You can also add icons to the demo to make them more recognizable.

```json
{
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "version": 2,
  "icons": {
    "start": "<name of the icon (optional)>",
    "end": "<name of the icon (optional)>"
  },
  "steps": []
}
```

<Aside type="note">
Use the icon names you can find in the [icon listing](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels#icon-listing) from the Visual Studio Code documentation.

Here is an example of a demo where you create a file and open it:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://demotime.show/demo-time.schema.json",
  "title": "Demo",
  "description": "Demo description",
  "version": 2,
  "demos": [
    {
      "title": "Create and open sample.json",
      "description": "Create a sample.json file with some content.",
      "icons": {
        "start": "file-code",
        "end": "pass-filled"
      },
      "steps": [
        {
          "action": "create",
          "path": "sample.json",
          "content": "{\n  \"firstName\": \"Elio\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Struyf\"\n}"
        },
        {
          "action": "open",
          "path": "sample.json"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using the add demo step command

You can use the **Demo Time: Add demo step** command to quickly add the current text selection as a demo step to insert, highlight, unselect, or delete the text.

To use this command, you can follow these steps:

1. Select the text you want to add as a demo step.
2. Open the command palette by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>.
3. Search for the **Demo Time: Add demo step** command.
4. Click on the command to add the selected text as a demo step.
5. Select the demo file in which you want to add the step.
6. Select the type of action you want to add (insert, highlight, unselect, or delete).
  <Image class="mx-auto" src={demoStepImage} alt="Add a demo step from the &quot;Demo Time: Add demo step&quot; command" />
7. Select if you want to add it to an existing demo or create a new one.

## Executing the demo

Each demo you add will be available in the **Demo Time** view. You can execute each step by clicking on the demo title or starting the presentation mode.

## Adding notes to your demos

You are also able to add notes to your demos. These notes can be used to provide additional information for yourself or others who will be executing the demo.

The notes should be created as a markdown file in the `.demo` folder. Here is an example of how you can add notes to your demo:

```json
{
  "title": "<title>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "version": 2,
  "steps": [...],
  "notes": {
    "path": "<relative path to the file>",
    "showOnTrigger": "<show notes on trigger (optional) - default is false>"
  }
}
```

## Implementing other demos and steps

You can add more demos and steps to the `demos` array. In the [actions section](/actions/) of the documenation, you can find all the available actions you can use to create your demos.
